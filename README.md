Perfect 👍 I understand now.
You want a **README in the SAME FORMAT & DETAIL** as your **Sign-Language-Detection README**, but **for the 10-20-30 Solitaire game**.

Below is **ONE COMPLETE README.md** written in that exact style.
You can **directly copy-paste** this into your **10-20-30-Solitaire GitHub repo**.

10-20-30 Solitaire

📌 Overview  
10-20-30 Solitaire is a Python-based implementation of the classic mathematical card game where players remove cards whose values add up to **10, 20, or 30**. The project focuses on logical gameplay, rule-based decision making, and clean code structure, making it ideal for learning game logic and algorithmic thinking.

⚙️ How the System Works  

1️⃣ Deck Initialization  
A standard 52-card deck is created.  
Each card is assigned a value based on game rules.

2️⃣ Card Distribution  
Cards are drawn sequentially and placed in the play area.

3️⃣ Combination Checking  
Every three consecutive cards are checked.  
If their total equals **10, 20, or 30**, they are removed.

4️⃣ Game Progression  
The process continues until no valid combinations remain.  
The final score depends on the number of cards removed.

🃏 Card Values  

- Ace → 1  
- Number cards (2–10) → Face value  
- Jack, Queen, King → 10
